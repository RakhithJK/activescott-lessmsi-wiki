# How do I use this thing anyway?

# Introduction

Basically download the latest release from the [download page](https://github.com/berelium/bonkonauts.github.io/releases/download/release/AppSetup.zip).

You will end up with a zip file like lessmsi-v1.0.8.zip. Extract all files into a directory on your computer.

In that directory you will find a file named lessmsi.exe. Run that executable to see the user interface of the program.
Some more screenshots with notes are on the [home page](http://code.google.com/p/lessmsi/).
